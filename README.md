# MNIST CNN LeNet 5
in this project I am analyzing cleaning and visualizing the MNIST data set then after that I am doing classification on it using convolutional neural network (CNN) by the following steps:
1. Data wrangling (Data gathering , Data assessing , Data cleaning).
2. Exploratory Data Analysis.
3. Making some conclusions about the data.
4. Using the famous CNN LeNet 5 architecture to acheive high accuracy.
